My favorite book is the Maze Runner and did you know that it is about a boy who gets trapped in a maze with a society of other boys who try to find a way out of the maze everyday, but monsters come out at night to hunt them down while they are in the maze. I won't spoil the ending for your sake and I'll end this paragraph here.
